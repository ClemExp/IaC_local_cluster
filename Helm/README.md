# Helm tests
The tests will be carried out in the following order, so that we can understand them little by little:
* First, we will do the sample-service test scenario.
* Second, we will do the traefik scenario.
* Lastly, we will do the dashboard-traefik.

The first scenario is just a basic test to get the basic concepts of helm, kind and kubernetes. The second one, will be used to install traefik. And finally, in the dashboard-traefik, we will create a dashboard to have a traefik portal.

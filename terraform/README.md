# Terraform tests
The tests will be carried out in the following order, so that we can understand them little by little:
* First, we will do the kind test scenario.
* Then, we will do the dashboard-traefik scenario.

The first scenario is just a basic test to get the basic concepts of terraform, kind and kubernetes. And finally, in the dashboard-traefik, we will create a dashboard to have a traefik portal with terraform.
